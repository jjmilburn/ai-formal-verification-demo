    "# TLA+ Demo: LLM-Assisted Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLA+** is a formal specification language for concurrent and distributed systems. Unlike Dafny and Lean, TLA+ uses **model checking**: it exhaustively explores all possible states to find bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll:\n",
    "1. See what a TLA+ specification looks like\n",
    "2. Ask an LLM to generate a spec from natural language\n",
    "3. Run TLC (the model checker) to find counterexamples\n",
    "4. Feed counterexamples back to the LLM to fix the spec\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why TLA+?\n",
    "\n",
    "TLA+ is used at Amazon, Microsoft, and other companies for distributed systems:\n",
    "- AWS uses it to verify DynamoDB, S3, and other services\n",
    "- It catches subtle concurrency bugs that testing misses\n",
    "- The \"genefication\" workflow (from [Murat Demirbas's blog](https://www.mydistributed.systems/2025/01/genefication.html)) shows how LLMs can draft TLA+ specs\n",
